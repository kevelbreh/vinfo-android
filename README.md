# vinfo-android

Android application which connects to the simple `vinfo-server` vehicle endpoint

# Description

> Create the android application
> Ability to scan a vin
> Display base vehicle info

## Notes

This is a simplistic application with minimal UI or UX implementations. It does however follow basic MVP structure with unit tests.

You'll have to change the endpoint to whatever server is hosting `vinfo-server` on the `application` extension class.
